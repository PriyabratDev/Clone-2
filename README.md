Website Clone Made Using React
I have Used first Mind page and made it available inside another folder named as "Mind" then checked Fitnees page whose fitness.jsx file is in app.jsx file and made it available inside another folder named as "Fitness".
I have also commented the navbar code after writing it out please correct that one.
please copy my app.jsx in the folder fitness inside file fitness.jsx and change the path accordingly so that it can run properly.
